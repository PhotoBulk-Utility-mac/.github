## About PhotoBulk

PhotoBulk is a streamlined and efficient desktop application designed to handle repetitive image editing tasks on a large scale. It addresses the need to process multiple images—whether they are product photos, screenshots, or personal pictures—without opening each one individually in a heavy editor like Photoshop. The application provides a straightforward drag-and-drop interface where you add your images, queue up the desired actions (watermark, resize, rename, etc.), and apply them to the entire batch with a single click. This saves an immense amount of time for bloggers, small business owners, developers, photographers, and anyone who regularly needs to prepare images for web, social media, or archival.

The strength of PhotoBulk lies in its focused simplicity and speed. It excels at the most common batch operations: adding copyright watermarks to protect your work, resizing images to meet platform requirements (e.g., Instagram, eBay), and converting file formats (e.g., HEIC to JPG). It also includes useful extras like adjusting image quality (compression), rotating, and adding borders. While not a pixel-level editor, its purpose is to automate the tedious, repetitive steps, freeing you up for more creative or important work. It's the perfect companion for quick, bulk preparation of image collections.
